        <article>
            <P>My name is Denis Andonov and I am a 20 year old student who is currently enrolled in the EXSM 3932: HTML5 Fundementals program. I am taking this course and other prequiste courses in order to be elligeble for the Full Stack Web Developer program offered by the University of Alberta.

                What I love about HTML5 is that it combines creativity, problem-solving, and technology in a way that can have a real impact on people's lives. Whether it's creating a website for a small business, developing a new tool that makes people's lives easier, or simply sharing ideas and knowledge online.
                
                My journey started when a friend of my mother offered a website called Udemy which has courses on introductions to computer programming. I purchased a course on an introduction to Python and enjoyed it. After completing the course I set up a GitHub account to record my progress and see an evolution of my code. After completing the course I started to work on projects by myself with some help from youtube videos.
            
                I am now working towards being a full stack web developer.</P>
